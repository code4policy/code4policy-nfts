  <h1 class="homepagetitle">NFT: Non-Fungible Token</h1>

    <h3 class="FAQ">What is an NFT?</h3>
      <p class="FAQAns">NFT stands for non-fungible token, and it is an ownership claim on a unique digital asset.</p>

    <h3 class="FAQ">Slow down. What does fungible mean?</h3>
	      <p class="FAQAns">A fungible asset is something interchangeable, like how any dollar bill is worth the same as another dollar bill, or how 1 Bitcoin can be exchanged for another Bitcoin and you have the same value. Unlike fungible assets, NFTs can’t be exchanged for equal value. Some people make the comparison to a one-of-a-kind baseball card. Trade it for another baseball card, and you have something with a different value.</p>

    <h3 class="FAQ">Ok, so trading cards.</h3>
	      <p class="FAQAns">Kind of. Right now, NFTs are typically associated with digital art. But they can represent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/14/15-nft-use-cases-that-could-go-mainstream/" target="_blank">any number of different digital assets</a>, like music, event tickets, community membership, and more. Some enthusiasts have even promoted the idea that NFTs could be used in healthcare to decentralize and give patients greater control over their healthcare records.</p>

    <h3 class="FAQ">Doesn't this have something to do with Blockchain (whatever that is)?</h3>
	      <p class="FAQAns">Yes! Blockchain technolgy creates a decentralized network to maintain and update a ledge of transactions or exchanges. Importantly, that ledger is public, so anyone can see and review it. Basically, lots of computers are nodes in the network, and they receive and verify transactions with cryptography to add a new "block" to the network's ledger. Because the ledger is distributed across the network, the data on the ledger is impossible to alter (without the seemingly impossible task of controlling over 50% of nodes on the network).
	      <br><br>
	    	NFTs are unique assets, represented by one-of-a-kind identifying code, that exist on blockchains. Those blockchains' public ledgers record transactions buying and selling NFTs. The most common blockchains on which NFTs are traded right now are Ethereum, Solana, and Tezos. Wnat to learn more about those? See our page for amateur investors.</p>
