  		<div  class="FAQ">Let's dive right into it.</div><br>
  			
  			<div class="FAQAns">So you‚Äôve heard that NFTs are the rage and they are now being sold at Christie‚Äôs for tens of millions of dollars, but what are NFTs? NFT stands for non-fungible token. As opposed to dollar bills or Bitcoins, which are fungible and any one dollar bill can be exchanged for any other perfectly equivalent dollar bill, NFTs are non-fungible, unique digital assets that cannot be exchanged for other equivalent NFTs. Some people make the comparison to a one-of-a-kind baseball card. Trade it for another baseball card, and you have something with a different value.

  			<br><br>

  			NFTs are unique digital assets, represented by one-of-a-kind identifying code, that exists on a blockchain. <span class="italicsquote">‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt actually own anything!‚Äù</span> you scream at your computer. And, well, you‚Äôre right that you don‚Äôt own anything physical. But somewhere on a blockchain there is a contract that says that the wallet you (hopefully) have the password to is in possession of that NFT. And that‚Äôs valuable! 

  			<br><br>

  			Are you still confused as to why an NFT with Jack Dorsey‚Äôs first tweet is worth $2.9 million? Don‚Äôt worry, get excited!

  			<br><br>

  			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">just setting up my twttr</p>&mdash; jack‚ö°Ô∏è (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2006</a></blockquote>

  			</div>

  			<div class="FAQ">What are the different types of NFTs?</div><br>
  			<div class="FAQAns">The <a href="https://nonfungible.com/">NonFungible<a> platform categorizes NFTs into Collectible, Metaverse, Game, Art, and Utility. According to a recent article by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/nft-sales-hit-25-billion-2021-growth-shows-signs-slowing-2022-01-10/">Reuters<a>, Collectible have the most transactions, followed by Utility, Art, Metaverse and finally, Game.</div><br>

  			<div class="FAQ">Why should I buy an NFT?</div><br>
  			<div class="FAQAns">Mainly, there are two ways of making money through NFTs. Creators, artists and musicians are using NFTs as direct paths to the market where they can publish their NFTs and profit from direct sales. Technologists, investors and early adapters are buying these NFTs, holding them while the price goes up and selling them at a profit. You might be thinking to buying an NFT to dip your toe into the NFT waters, to take advantage of your amazing knowledge of a specific market where NFTs are booming or maybe you, like Eminem, Jimmy Fallon and Steve Aoki, want to be part of the elite community of an NFT collection.

  			<br><br>

  			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">#NewProfilePic I don‚Äôt need to see when I have the vision üöÄ welcome the 8th @BoredApeYC to the Aoki family. #9309</p>&mdash; Steve Aoki (@steveaoki) <a href="https://twitter.com/steveaoki/status/1478184396989501440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1478184396989501440%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F86135%2Fbiggest-celebrity-nft-owners-bored-ape-yacht-club ">Jan 3, 2022</a></blockquote>

  			<br><br>

  			But we can only tell you to be careful. The NFT market is in its early days and we are only starting to understand how these markets will function. NFTs are risky assets and past performance does not guarantee future returns.

  			<div class="FAQ">Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</div><br>
  			<div class="FAQAns">
  					In the beginning there was blockchain technology and its first popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Bitcoin was created in 2008 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto and uses blockchain technology to record the exchange of (fungible) digital tokens. Blockchain technology creates a decentralized network to maintain and update a ledge of transactions or exchanges. Importantly, that ledger is public, so anyone can see and review it. Basically, lots of computers are nodes in the network, and they receive and verify transactions with cryptography to add a new "block" to the network's ledger. Because the ledger is distributed across the network, the data on the ledger is impossible to alter (without the seemingly impossible task of controlling over 50% of nodes on the network). 

  					<br><br>
  			
  			<div class="FAQ">In come the NFTs</div><br>
  			<div class="FAQAns">
  					As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies grew in popularity, a new question arose: could the blockchain be used to exchange assets other than cryptocurrencies? The first big success in answering this question came in 2017 when creative technologists John Watkinson and Matt Hall created <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks">Cryptopunks</a> ‚Äî a set of 10,000 small pixelated images published on the Ethereum blockchain. When they were created, these low-resolution images were given away for free, and today they are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/investment/news/15-most-expensive-nfts-of-2021-by-pak-beeple-cryptopunks-and-others/slidelist/88540923.cms#slideid=88541111">sold for up to tens of millions of dollars</a>!

  					<br><br>

  					Once Cryptopunks took off, a new type of token on the Ethereum blockchain ‚Äî <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">the ERC721</a> ‚Äî was specially designed for contracts that could track the exchange of claims on unique digital assets, known as non-fungible tokens or NFTs. With this improved infrastructure in place on the Ethereum blockchain, new projects like <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">Cryptokitties</a> emerged for their fifteen minutes (and millions of dollars) of fame. New blockchains, like Solana, Tezos, and Wax have emerged as the competing blockchains for NFTs and publishers from Beeple to Snoop Dogg have taken over the digital world.

  	 	<div class="howtosection">
  					To begin your journey of buying a Non Fungible Token, you must first select a platform, or marketplace, where NFTs can be bought and sold. Popular marketplaces include <a href="https://opensea.io/" class="link">OpenSea</a>, <a href="https://niftygateway.com/" class="link">NiftyGateway</a>, <a href="https://superrare.com/" class="link">SuperRare</a>, and <a href="https://rarible.com/"class="link">Rariable</a> . These marketplaces allow for NFTs to be minted to blockchains, and are typically associated with specific cryptocurrencies. <br><br>

  					OpenSea, NiftyGateway, and Rariable: popular NFT marketplaces. <br><br>

  					In order to participate in the NFT market, you must establish a wallet in your chosen currency. Popular crypto wallet platforms include <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" class="link">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/en-us/" class="link">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://metamask.io/" class="link">Metamask</a>, and <a href="https://www.exodus.com/" class="link">Exodus</a>. The marketplace platform often determines which currency is used for the NFT process ‚Äì for popular site OpenSea, transactions are completed through <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" class="link">Ethereum</a>. <br><br>In order to purchase NFTs, you must fund your crypto wallet. Crypto wallets can only hold cryptocurrency, but you can purchase cryptocurrency through a cryptocurrency exchange, which will allow you to use your credit card or bank details to purchase cryptocurrency. <br><br>Once funded, you can locate NFTs in the marketplace to purchase. Most NFTs are sold through a timed auction with a price minimum set by the creator, but marketplaces also allow for a listed single price available for the first buyer. In an NFT auction, if you are the highest bidder, the NFT will now be yours and the bid amount will be debited from your wallet, along with a commission fee from the marketplace.<br><br>Now that you are an NFT owner, you can list your own NFT for sale - through an auction or single price sale. Much of the wealth obtained through the NFT market comes from the resale of valuable NFTs.<br><br>Happy NFT selling!<br><br>

  			<div class="FAQ">Not all cryptocurrencies are created equal</div><br>
  			<div class="FAQAns">
  					As explained in the ‚Äòhow to buy and sell NFTs‚Äô tutorial, NFTs are not traded in USD but in cryptocurrencies instead. When deciding which cryptocurrency to invest in, it is important to understand that not all cryptocurrencies are created equal. As depicted in the chart below, the market capitalization of Bitcoin and Ethereum is not comparable to the market capitalization of smaller coins like Luna or Dogecoin. Larger cryptocurrencies often have more institutional investment and are more stable. Smaller cryptocurrencies often offer a higher upside but might have a more negative downside.

  			<div class="FAQ">The price of the underlying cryptocurrency has a direct impact on the value of your NFT</div><br>
  			<div class="FAQAns">
  					Because NFTs built on blockchains, they are normally sold in cryptocurrencies and the price of the coin has a direct impact on the dollar value of the NFT. This happens through two mechanisms. The first is the direct impact,  if your NFT is worth 1 ETH and at the moment of purchase 1 ETH = $3,000, then your NFT is worth $3,000. If ETH rallies to $4,000, now your NFT is worth 33% more. The second is the indirect impact, if your NFT is built on the Solana blockchain and technologists start becoming skeptical of it, the price of your NFT might drop both in SOL and in USD-equivalent.

  			<div class="FAQ">Cryptocurrencies often correlate with one another</div><br>
  			<div class="FAQAns">
  					If you track cryptocurrencies long enough, you will notice that their price changes often correlate with another and they follow cycles. As in all markets, the ideal is to buy when price dip and sell when they soar.
