	<h1> A step by step process on how to buy and sell NFTs </h1>

	<p> To begin your journey of minting a Non Fungible Token, you must first select a platform, or marketplace, where NFTs can be bought and sold. Popular marketplaces include <a href="https://opensea.io/" class="link" id='normal'>OpenSea</a>, <a href="https://niftygateway.com/" class="link">NiftyGateway</a>, <a href="https://superrare.com/" class="link">SuperRare</a>, and <a href="https://rarible.com/"class="link">Rariable</a> . These marketplaces allow for NFTs to be minted to blockchains, and are typically associated with specific cryptocurrencies.</p>

	<p> In order to participate in the NFT market, you must establish a wallet in your chosen currency. Popular crypto wallet platforms include <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/en-us/">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>, and <a href="https://www.exodus.com/">Exodus</a>. The marketplace platform often determines which currency is used for the NFT process – for popular site OpenSea, transactions are completed through <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a>.</p>

	<p> In order to purchase NFTs, you must fund your crypto wallet, . Once funded, you can locate NFTs in the marketplace and place bids on each NFT. Many marketplaces allow creators to set price minimums for bids to purchase their NFT. If you are the highest bidder, the NFT will now be yours and will be deposted into your crypto address. </p>



	<p> NFT marketplaces allow for the minting of NFTs, through allowing you to upload a file from your computer to the marketplace. The marketplace will allow for the upload of images, videos, audio files, 3D models, or other filetypes to be minted as a Non Fungible Token. Many marketplaces also allow for the upload of NFTs to specific collections, which motivates collectors to invest in multiple NFTs. Some marketplaces may require initial fees, payable in crypto, in order to mint an NFT on the market. </p>

	<p> Once your NFT is minted, you can list it for sale. Many NFTs are sold through a timed auction, but marketplaces often allow for a listed single price available to the first buyer willing to pay. Following the sale of an NFT, the marketplace will likely take a commission fee. </p>
