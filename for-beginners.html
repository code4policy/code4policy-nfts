  			<div class="FAQAns">
  					In the beginning there was bitcoin. The first cryptocurrency is created in 2008 (by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto) and uses blockchain technology to record the exchange of digital tokens across a decentralized network without intermediaries. As the bitcoin network grows, a new question naturally arises: could this technology be used to exchange assets other than bitcoin? <br><br>The first big success in answering this question came in 2017 with <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks" class="link">Cryptopunks</a> ‚Äî a set of 10,000 small pixelated images produced by creative technologists John Watkinson and Matt Hall on the Ethereum blockchain. These low-res images were given away for free, and today <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/forsale" class="link">you can buy one<a> on an NFT exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars (at least)!<br><br>

				Think about it like a first edition book, or a baseball card, or a crown jewel. <span class="italicsquote">‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt actually own anything!‚Äù</span> you scream at your computer. And, well, you‚Äôre right that you don‚Äôt own anything physical. But on the Ethereum blockchain there is a contract which says for sure that the wallet you (hopefully) have the password to is in possession of that image. And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs valuable! How often do you actually sit down to read a first edition of The Great Gatsby book or see the Queen wearing her crown jewels, anyway?</div><br>

			<div class="FAQAns">
				Once Cryptopunks took off, a new type of token on the Ethereum blockchain ‚Äî <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721" class="link">the ERC721</a> ‚Äî was specially designed for contracts that could track the exchange of claims on unique digital assets, known as non-fungible tokens. <br><br>With this improved infrastructure in place on the Ethereum blockchain, new projects like Cryptokitties emerged for their fifteen minutes (and millions of dollars) of fame. New blockchains, like Solana, And in 2021, as you‚Äôre probably aware, all sorts of NFTs ‚Äî from Beeple to Bored Apes took over the digital world.

  			<div  class="FAQ" id="FAQ1">What is an NFT?</div><br>
  			
  			<div class="FAQAns">NFT stands for non-fungible token, and it is an ownership claim on a unique digital asset.</div><br>

  			<div class="FAQ">Slow down. What does fungible mean?</div>
		      	<div class="FAQAns">A fungible asset is something interchangeable, like how any dollar bill is worth the same as another dollar bill, or how 1 Bitcoin can be exchanged for another Bitcoin and you have the same value. Unlike fungible assets, NFTs can‚Äôt be exchanged for equal value. Some people make the comparison to a one-of-a-kind baseball card. Trade it for another baseball card, and you have something with a different value.</div><br>

	   		 <div class="FAQ">Ok, so trading cards.</div>
		    	<div class="FAQAns">Kind of. Right now, NFTs are typically associated with digital art. But they can represent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/14/15-nft-use-cases-that-could-go-mainstream/" class="link" target="_blank">any number of different digital assets</a>, like music, event tickets, community membership, and more. Some enthusiasts have even promoted the idea that NFTs could be used in healthcare to decentralize and give patients greater control over their healthcare records.</div><br>

	    	<div class="FAQ">Doesn't this have something to do with Blockchain (whatever that is)?</div>
		    	<div class="FAQAns">Yes! Blockchain technolgy creates a decentralized network to maintain and update a ledge of transactions or exchanges. Importantly, that ledger is public, so anyone can see and review it. Basically, lots of computers are nodes in the network, and they receive and verify transactions with cryptography to add a new "block" to the network's ledger. Because the ledger is distributed across the network, the data on the ledger is impossible to alter (without the seemingly impossible task of controlling over 50% of nodes on the network).
		      <br><br>
		    	NFTs are unique assets, represented by one-of-a-kind identifying code, that exist on blockchains. Those blockchains' public ledgers record transactions buying and selling NFTs. The most common blockchains on which NFTs are traded right now are Ethereum, Solana, and Tezos.
